    <h2>How to make Beavertail</h2>
    <p>What I remember from my younger days is that beavertails were a yummy pastry that you could get with different toppings like jam, sugar and cinnamon or garlic and cheese. Apparently, it's now big business. But why bother when you can make your own at home with simple ingredients?</p>
 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix yeast, water and sugar.</li>
    <li>Add the â…“ Cup of sugar, milk, vanilla, eggs, oil, salt, and most of the flour to the yeast mixture. Knead for 5 to 8 minutes using a dough hook, adding flour as needed to form a firm smooth, elastic dough.</li>
    <li>Place dough in a lightly greased bowl. Place a warm towel on top of the bowl and "seal". If you are not going to use the dough right away, you can refrigerate the dough at this point. Let rise for about 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat about 4 inches of corn oil in fryer (or whatever you usually use for frying). Temperature of the oil should be about 385 degrees.</li>
    <li>Turn the beaver tail once to fry until both sides are deep brown. Lift the beaver tails out with tongs and drain on paper towels.</li>
    <li>Fill a large bowl with a few cups of white sugar and cinnamon. Toss the beaver tails in the sugar mixture, coating both sides and then shake off the excess.</li>
</ol>
