        <h2> How to Make Maple Candy</h2>
            <p>Maple leaf candy is an authentic sweet with just two ingredients: maple syrup and butter. It doesn't get much simpler—or sweeter—than that. Maple syrup is boiled, mixed with just a bit of butter, and then molded into beautiful leaf-shaped candies. This candy is a classic in New England and Canada—and for good reason—as it's a fun way to enjoy maple syrup.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Maple Syrup (Authentic)</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
            </ul>
         <h3> Steps </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour the syrup into a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan and place it over medium heat. </li>
                <li>Bring the syrup to a boil.</li>
                <li>Stir until the butter is fully melted and incorporated.</li>
                <li>Stir the candy vigorously with a wooden spoon until it thickens, lightens in color, and turns opaque, which should take about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Working quickly, spoon the candy into the candy molds.</li>
                <li>Allow them to cool, then pop them out of the molds</li>
            </ol>
